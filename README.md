# Pew Pew: The Re-Invasioning

Part of a project for an undergraduate Software Engineering course. This is a slightly new take on the classic Space Invaders. Enemies 
will occasionally drop power-ups which give the player abilities, including a shield that protects against a single hit, rapid fire, and 
a special weapon. In addition, the role of the UFO that flys along the top of the screen in the classic Space Invaders has been expanded to a mini-boss, requiring 3 hits to destroy and fires a laser at the player.

Currently, the project is incomplete. There is no sound, and the game lacks content to truely set it apart from other Space Invader "clones." There are no plans in the near or distant future to complete it. The game was built from scratch using Android Studio. No  additional API's or code libraries were used.

## My contributions

The gameplay code was designed and written largely by myself, based off of other game source code and API's I'd been exposed to prior. No code libraries were used other than Android's native libraries. I was also responsible for creating the artwork.
